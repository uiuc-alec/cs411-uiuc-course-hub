## Project Summary

UIUC Course Investigator is a project aimed providing students with very helpful course information, similar to the [MCS website](https://uiucmcs.org/), but for the entire university and with more functionality. This app will contain extremely helpful information such as user reviews, course ratings, difficulty ratings, semesters offered, professors who have recently taught the class and their ratings, average GPA from recent semesters, tools used in the course, and GPT generated descriptions (stretch goal). This combines a lot of the useful information from the [grade disparity website](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/), [HKN Wiki](https://wiki.hkn.illinois.edu/), [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), [UIUC Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/), and [MCS website](https://uiucmcs.org/) for all the courses at UIUC.
